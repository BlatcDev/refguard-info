# Privacy Policy for RefGuard Alpha

**Last Updated: 31/12/2024**

## Introduction

Welcome to RefGuard Alpha, a browser extension designed to protect affiliate/referral data from unexpected changes. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the data processed by our extension.

## Data Collection

**What We Collect:**

- **Affiliate Parameters**: RefGuard Alpha monitors affiliate parameters in URLs to detect changes. This data includes affiliate IDs, which are not considered personal information.

**How We Collect Data:**

- The extension uses local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to store affiliate data temporarily for its functionality. This data is not sent to any external servers or services.

## Data Usage

**Purpose:**

- The collected affiliate parameters are used solely for the purpose of monitoring and alerting users to changes in affiliate data. This helps in maintaining the integrity of affiliate links.

**No Data Sharing:**

- We do not share, sell, or transmit any data collected by the extension to third parties.

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`. This means the data remains on your machine and is not accessible by us or any external entities.

## User Rights

**Access and Control:**

- You have the right to access, modify, or delete the affiliate data stored by the extension. This can be done through the extension's settings or by clearing your browser's local storage.

**Data Portability:**

- Since the data is stored locally, you can export or import it as needed.

## Security

- We take reasonable measures to protect the data stored by the extension from unauthorized access or alteration. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

- We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
